# Atreus Firmware

This is my own firmware for the [Atreus keyboard](https://github.com/technomancy/atreus) I designed and built.

## Usage

Install `gcc-avr` and the
[teensy loader](http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/loader_cli.html).

Run `make upload` with the keyboard plugged in, and then hit the reset button.

To use another C layout, copy it to `layout.h`. To use a JSON layout,
run `make jsonlayout LAYOUT=softdvorak`.

Designed to run on a Teensy 2 but could probably be adapted to run on
other USB-capable atmega boards.

## Layouts in JSON

See `qwerty.json` for an example.

The layout JSON should simply be a three-dimensional array. At the top
level, every array element is a layer. You can have up to 64
layers. Each layer is an array of rows, and each row is an array of
keycodes. A keycode can either be a keypress (described in
`usb_keyboard.h`), a keypress with a modifier (like `["shift", "7"]`
to insert a `&` character), `"fn"` to switch to layer 1 while held, or
`["layer", 0]` to switch to a given layer beyond while the key is
being held. It's also advised to include a `["reset"]` key as this is
used to program updates to the firmware without opening the case to
hit the hardware reset button. Finally, an empty string can be used to
indicate a keypress which does nothing.

The JSON layouts are parsed by the `atreus.el` code in Emacs. `M-x
atreus-make` will compile a given JSON file into a `.hex` file for
uploading, and `M-x atreus-view` will compile JSON into an HTML table
and open it in the browser. But the `jsonlayout` makefile target
automates this.
Alternatively there is a script `atreus-layout-to-svg.sh` that will
compile the json into HTML document with embedded SVG layouts. The
`jsonlayout` makefile target also automates this. 
(`atreus-layout-to-svg.sh` relies on sed and jq)

## Layouts in C

Layouts in C are arrays of integers. For basic key presses, use the
keycodes defined in `usb_keyboard.h`. For modified key presses use the
`CTRL()`, `SHIFT()`, `ALT()` and `GUI()` macros from atreus.c. These
may be stacked for holding down multiple modifiers together. Layouts
can also include references to functions to execute. Place a `void`
function pointer in the `layout_functions` array and use the
`FUNCTION()` macro providing the index of the function, and that
keypress will cause the function to be invoked.

The `layouts` pointer should be set to an array of layouts. Every scan
through the keyboard matrix will set the current layout to the
`current_layout_number`th element of the `layouts` array. To make a
keybinding that changes the current layout use the `LAYER()` macro.

However, most functions will be called the final pass where each
keypress is looked up in the currently active layout. That means if
you have a function that changes the current layout, it needs to run
sooner so it can affect regular keycode lookups. The `PRE_FUNCTION()`
macro will trigger functions that run on a separate pre-invoke pass
before the rest of the keycodes are looked up, so this is how
layer-changing functions should be defined.

## How it works

Since the microcontroller has a limited number of pins, the switches
are wired in a matrix where each has its positive contact connected to
those in the same row and its negative contact wired in with those
above and below it. Reading the state of the switches can only happen
a row at a time: a single row (output) pin is brought low, and all the
column inputs are read. Any of them that read low are recorded as a
keypress. Low voltage is used to for pressed keys because each input
pin has a built-in pullup resistor.

However, because of the electrical properties of switches, it's
necessary to go through a
[debouncing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch#Contact_bounce)
process as the switches settle. This means taking a few scans over the
matrix and waiting until you get N successive reads of the same state
before counting any single keypress or release as legitimate.

## TODO

* Improve debouncing
* Support layer toggle bindings
